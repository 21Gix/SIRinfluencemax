# SIRinfluencemax

Simulation based on SIR model from given dataset(s)
How to use: 
1) compile main.py
2) make sure your text file has the same structure of "prova.txt" or "college.txt" (you can use prova to test the file working since it's very light) and it's located in the same directory as "main.py" otherwise make sure to write the whole file path in the next step
3) when asked in console, write the name of your text file INCLUDING the file extension (must be .txt)
4) when asked for input about infected nodes, provide the number of the node(s) and type stop when you're good to go
