# SIRinfluencemax

Simulation based on SIR model from given dataset(s)
How to use: 
1) compile main.py
2) make sure your text file has the same structure of "prova.txt" (you can use that to test it out) and it's located in the same directory as "main.py"
3) when asked in console, write the name of your text file INCLUDING the file extension (must be .txt)
4) for now, this is all that has been implemented :)
